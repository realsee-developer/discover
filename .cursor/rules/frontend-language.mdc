# Frontend Language Guide

- The public-facing site is English-only. When adding or editing UI copy under `frontend/`, stick to English strings.
- Avoid introducing Simplified Chinese (or other non-English languages) in new code, data fixtures, or component text unless explicitly required for localization.
- Keep developer comments and commit messages in English for consistency with the codebase.
