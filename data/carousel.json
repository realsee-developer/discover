    "title": "Bolling Hall Museum, Bradford",
    "description": "Bolling Hall Museum is a fascinating journey through the lives and times of the Bradford families who lived there for more than five hundred years. You can find it just a mile from Bradford city centre, sitting in a beautiful,  quiet, leafy garden. \n\nWith parts of the building dating from Medieval times, Bolling Hall is a mix of styles and ideas with every nook and cranny packed with history.  For many years the hall was home to two grand families, the Bollings and the Tempests, who were involved in some of the most important (and violent) moments in the history of England and our city.\n\nDuring the Civil War the household supported the Royalist cause, and the house provided a stronghold during the ‘siege of Bradford’.\n\nRooms are furnished and decorated to give an accurate taste of life at different periods of the house’s history, and the fascinating furniture on display includes a superb bed made for Harewood House by Thomas Chippendale.\n\nBolling Hall Library is also now located in Bolling Hall Museum. More information on the library can be found here.\n\nThere isn’t a café onsite, but The Lodge Café, run by the Friends of Bowling Park, is  just over the road.",
