Avi Gold		Immersive storyteller using 360° capture and 3D modeling to create interactive brand experiences.	"As a 3rd generation photographer and artist I am on the cutting edge of immersive technology and tell stories in 360° and 3D that invite viewers to step inside a narrative—not just view a space.

As co-founder of 3D CAM Pros, an innovative tech partner with Realsee, I combine high-end 360 capture, advanced Gaussian Splatting techniques, and photorealistic 3D modeling to transform real-world locations into living, interactive experiences.
I’m an early innovator on the Realsee platform, where I’ve pushed the technology to new heights—developing and refining features like Video Fusion, Guided Tours, dynamic hotspots, multi-stop routes, and supplemental media layers to create rich, guided stories for every project.

By blending augmented reality elements and fully realized 3D models, I give clients a powerful way to communicate their brand on the powerful Realsee platform in a way that captivates audiences and converts viewers into engaged customers.
From luxury real estate, museums, cultural destinations and one-of-a-kind events, every project is built to draw audiences into a seamless, unforgettable journey. I have 360 scanned over 1,000,000 sq. ft. over the last 3 years and plan to scan another 2,000,000 this year."
